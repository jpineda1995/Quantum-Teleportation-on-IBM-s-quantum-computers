# Quantum-Teleportation-on-IBM-s-quantum-computers

Standard quantum teleportation executing them on IBM's quantum computers. Deferred measurement Principle.

The deferred measurement Principle states that we can delay any measurement on the circuit to the end of the protocol by placing controlled operations. As currently IBM's devices do not use classical registers, the controlled operations for recovery are necessary in order to Bob obtain the correct quantum state on his side.
